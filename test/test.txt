===============================
LINUX
1) What is the 1st line of a bash script?
#!/bin/bash

2) Find all of the processes started by a particular user and kill them in a one liner.
ps -ef | grep log4sic0t | awk '{ print $2 }' | sudo xargs kill -9

3) On a linux router machine completely block access for an IP
sudo iptables -A INPUT -s xxx.xxx.xxx.xxx -j DROP

4) Change DNS locally on the server to use Google's 8.8.8.8 server in one line.
cp /etc/resolv.conf /etc/resolv.conf.bck ; echo "nameserver 8.8.8.8" > /etc/resolv.conf

5) Find all files newer than 5 days on a specific folder and delete them, one line command.
find /home/dir1 -type f -mtime -5 -ok rm {} \;
 
===============================
AWS
1)Create an automated way to deploy an AWS instance (free tier) that is running Nginx (port 80) webservice.
I choose ansible from a docker container where awscli is configured

2)This will point to a html file that has to display a text page (your choice).
http://13.41.203.155/

3)Share this on a Github project link and the URL to access the webservice.
